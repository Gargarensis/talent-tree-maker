# talent-tree-maker
A tool to create and modify talent trees.

For my DnD campaign, I was looking for a simple talent tree maker, but I could not find anything that satisfied me.
So, I made this little tool and I thought about sharing it with everyone.

Feel free to open Pull Requests or Issues.
The code is not optimal, but I wanted to make it quickly.
